# Conveels
Convenience Vehicle for Paraplegics People


A self-aware wheelchair would be immensely beneficial to people suffering from multiple disabilities as it eliminates the need     to  navigate around obstacles.
As the wheelchair can memorize once traversed paths , the time taken to travel the same route again is significantly reduced thus enabling greater ease in navigation.

# The problem statement

Aim : To design an intelligent wheelchair that memorizes a path once entered, and optimizes choosing multiple paths between two locations.

The solution to our problem statement can be broken into 4 crude parts:   
1. Enabling two modes within the bot- a teach mode, wherein the path is entered and memorised, and a self-drive mode, where the bot traverses a predefined path and learns to optimize it. 
2. Using Ultrasonic sensors avoid obstacles in the path of the bot and return to the same optimized path after skipping the obstacle.
3. Mapping of unpleasant inputs (obstacles) into the database of the bot.
4. Use of Machine Learning-Qlearning (a part of Reinforcement learning) to choose the optimal path out of multiple paths for traversal.

# Scope

1. Quadriplegics and victims of blindness who need wheelchairs for their locomotory necessities will stand to benefit the most from the successful execution of this project.
2. An intuitive wheelchair will thus make an huge impact on the the lives of differently abled persons and enable them to perform their day to day functions in a more efficient way.
